# Richi

Richi is an easy-to-use video player library written in Swift, with support for iOS, tvOS and macOS.
It provides you a VideoPlayerView with a simple yet powerful API, which makes playing videos a joy on iOS and macOS.

Richi builds on top of AVPlayer and aims at simplifying its interface, while providing additional features such as:

- Playback events using delegates
- Time observing using delegates and Combine
- Built-In URL-based memory and disk cache
- Support for header-based authentication and customizable asset loading
- Video snapshots

This library does **NOT** provide any video player UI in order to keep it as lightweight as possible, while making it highly flexible to use.
