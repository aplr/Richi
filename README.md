Richi is an easy-to-use media player library written in Swift, with support for iOS, tvOS and macOS.
It provides you with Video- and AudioPlayer classes, wrapping AVPlayer and making it more accessible.
Beyond that, Richi includes a subclassable VideoPlayerView with a simple yet powerful API, which makes playing videos a joy on both iOS and macOS.

## Features

Richi builds on top of AVPlayer and aims at simplifying its interface, while providing additional features such as:

â–º Playback events using delegates  
â–º Time observing using delegates and Combine  
â–º Built-In URL-based memory and disk cache (ðŸš§ WIP)  
â–º Header-based authentication  
â–º Customizable asset loading  
â–º Video snapshots

This library does **NOT** provide any video or audio player UI in order to keep it as lightweight as possible, while making it highly flexible to use.

## Installation

Richi is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) which is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system and automates the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Richi as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/aplr/Richi.git",
        .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")
    )
]
```

## Usage

```swift
import Richi

class UIViewController {

    /// The video player view
    lazy var videoPlayer: VideoPlayerView = {
        let view = VideoPlayerView()
        view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        view.actionAtEnd = .loop
        view.gravity = .aspectFit
        view.autoplay = true
        return view
    }()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Add the video player as a subview
        view.addSubview(videoPlayer)

        // Add layout constraints
        view.addConstraints([
            videoPlayer.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),
            videoPlayer.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor),
            videoPlayer.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor),
            videoPlayer.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor)
        ])

        let url = URL(string: "http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4")!

        let asset = Richi.Asset(url: url)

        // Load the asset. Since autoplay is enabled, playback
        // will start as soon as the asset is ready to play.
        videoPlayer.asset = asset
    }
}
```
